# ORM-IRIS
Open Raman Microscopy - Integrated Raman Imaging Software (ORM-IRIS or IRIS) is a complementary controller software of the modular [Open Raman Microscopy (ORM) system](www.openramanmicroscopy.org). IRIS is a **GUI-based app** to easily control a motorised Raman microscope (XY-stage, Z-stage, brightfield camera, and a spectrometer) for Raman imaging, offering full instrument controls, automatic Raman imaging, brightfield imaging and tiling, data management, basic data analyses, and more. It supports instruments from various manufacturers and is designed to be **completely modular**, including Ocean Optics, Andor, Princeton Instruments, Thorlabs, Physik Instrumente, Zaber, and more, such that controllers can be easily swapped within seconds by simply changing the chosen instruments in the config file.
